# Point Defect scattering

## Description
Electron-point-defect interaction plays a significant role in electron transport in materials. Point defects are the localized disruptions in the atomic structure, such as vacancies, interstitial atoms, or substitutional impurities, which affect the carrier transport. This code provides a method to accurately capture the electron-point-defect interations from first principle. By calculating electron-point-defect scattering matrix elements, we can obtain the carrier mobility limited by specific point-defects.
