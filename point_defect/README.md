# Point Defect scattering

## Description
Point defects (PDs) are the localized disruptions in the atomic structure, such as vacancies, interstitial atoms, or substitutional impurities. This code can calculate the matrix of electron-PD interaction, and the resulting scattering rate/relaxation time, as well as the transport properties (conductivity, mobility etc).

## Example outputs
Below are the calculated room-temperature charge carrier mobilities for 2D (monolayer) MX2 with different defect types.
