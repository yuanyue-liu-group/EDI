Electron-defect interaction is crucial to many processes and applications such as charge transport and light absoprtion/emssion. **EDI** (**e**lectron-**d**efect **i**nteraction) is a software package to calculate the electron-defect interaction and the associated properties from first principles. 

# Capabilities

Currently, EDI can calculate the following quantities for charge-neutral point defect:

- EDI matrix
- scattering rate/relaxation time
- carrier mobility/conductivity

We are also implementing or will implement methods for calculating:

- charged defects
- surfaces
- grain boundaries
