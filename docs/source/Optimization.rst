Parallelization level
------------

EDI is parallelized over k point pairs.
EDI uses optimal algorithm to calculate different part of scattering matrix element, giving the optimal performance of accuracy and effeciency.
The scalability of EDI is very good for system size. 
The calcualtion cost scales linearly with the volum of super cell, making it capable of calculating large systems easily.
Calculation of matrix element is parallelizede over k point pairs. 
EDI could easily run on large HPCs and utilize the full capacity.
