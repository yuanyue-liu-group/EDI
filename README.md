EDI is a software package to calculate electron-defect interaction and the associated properties from first principles.

Currently, EDI can calculate the following quantities:

(1) for charge-neutral point defects:
EDI matrix, carrier scattering rate/relaxation time, carrier mobility, electrical conductivity

(2) for surfaces:
carrier mobility and electrical conductivity of a slab

Underdevelopment:
(1) charged point defects
(2) grain boundaries
